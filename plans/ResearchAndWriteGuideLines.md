# this is a framework for guiding on how to research and write analysis on a chain
1. Research a chain
There are four good sources to understand a chain:
* twitter
* whitepaper
* discord
* github

One will need to collect information on four above sources to understand how a chain perform

2. Writing an analysis
Writing an analysis is no easy task. 

## One will need to ensure:
* Technical correctness
* Easy to read

## Tips:
* For casual readers, the less technical terms, the bette. Maintaining technical correctness will be much easier and it is also easier for casual reader to understand. __WARNING__: not too less technical terms. Too less technical terms will oversimplify concepts leading to misunderstand.
* Outline a logical structure for analysis first, then write.
