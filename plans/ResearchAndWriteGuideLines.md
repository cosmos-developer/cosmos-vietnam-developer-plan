One will need to collect information on four above sources to understand how a chain perform

## Writing an analysis
Writing an analysis is no easy task. 

### Writing Tips:
* For casual readers, the less technical terms, the better. Maintaining technical correctness will be much easier and it is also easier for casual reader to understand. __WARNING__: not too less technical terms. Too less technical terms will oversimplify concepts leading to misunderstand.
* Outline a logical structure for analysis first, then write.
* When writing, one will need to ensure:
    * Technical correctness
    * Easy to read
